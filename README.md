# Repository for integration of Substrate and CosmosSDK

We want to build the functionality that allows to turn blockchains built on Cosmos SDK into a full Polkadot parachains. 

Folder `substrate` contains everything necessary for running substrate node.

Folder `token` contains GRPC server with HTTP-GRPC gateway. The server implements a logic of a simple token, imitating the work of an applicatuon built with Cosmos SDK.

This line is added to check PR checks mechanism.
